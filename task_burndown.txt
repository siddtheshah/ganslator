    - Setup
        > Get the cloud credit from your columbia email.
    - Data download
        > Download dataset onto the cloud.
    - Training
        > Laptop does not have the hardware necessary to train this model.
        > I need to get to the point where I can have it run overnight and generate sample outputs.

Dataset:
    - Need to be able to read in RAVDESS data
        > Ravdess is 48khz. It's also sampled too quickly


Training/Saving:
    - Saving is set up.
    - Need to watch out for failures during training, since checkpoint
    - Model can train

Evaluation:
    - Need metrics
        > MOS is a potential metric.
        > Could also do a comparison against discriminator classification, though that's more complicated.
        > Much like generating images, this will be mostly subjective. Maybe that's ok.

Network:
    - Write attention mechanism
        > Refer to convolutional attention GAN
        > Learned about attention. Turns out, it's very similar to a fully connected layer with many channels when used on images.
        > The features of a single example can be enormous. If the sentence in ravdess is 4 seconds, then at 16kHz, we're
            talking an input size of 192KB. The good news is that the convolutional network doesn't really
            get larger with input length. It only scales with feature size.
        > Then modify the generator/discriminator with attention, possibly writing new versions.
