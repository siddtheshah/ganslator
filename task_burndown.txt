Cloud:
    - Setup

Dataset:
    - Need to be able to read in RAVDESS data
        > Ravdess is 48khz. It's sampled far too quickly.
        > Shell script in place to handle that. We can now train on ravdess, in theory.


Training/Saving:
    - Model trains, saves, and exports stuff. Need to check exported materials.

Evaluation:
    - Need metrics
        > MOS is a potential metric.
        > Could also do a comparison against discriminator classification, though that's more complicated.
        > Much like generating images, this will be mostly subjective.
        > Could potentially run text to speech to verify that the output words are roughly the same.

Network:
    - Write attention mechanism
        > This is pretty much a no-go. There's simply way too much memory required to do attention.
